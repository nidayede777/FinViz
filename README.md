# FinViz
Desktop application for visualising financial data.

This is a basic demo application for visualizing Stock Data. The app is built using Tkinter, a built-in GUI development package in Python. There are some other python libraries required to run this project, I have provided a requirements.txt file for simple installation of these packages.

To install the required packages - 

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

To run this project fork/clone the project and run the MainApp.py file in the APP folder.

`python MainApp.py`
